    <p class="text-m">Waste Segregation :</p>
    
    <p class="text-s">Office buildings, schools, stores, hotels, restaurants and other commercial and institutional buildings generate significant amounts of materials and waste. TheCleanOrg company is taking a step to help facility managers, building owners, tenants and other stakeholders improve waste management in their buildings, reduce costs and enhance sustainability.</p>
    
    <p class="text-s">Until recently, you might not have paid much attention to the waste your organization produces. Many organizations are content simply to establish a system for removing trash. Increasingly, greater attention is being paid to waste management, and pro-active organizations are seeing the benefits of establishing a waste reduction program.</p>

    <p class="text-m">Waste collection:</p>
    <p class="text-s">Your location and the amount of materials or wastes your organization generates shapes your opportunities to increase recycling.</p>
  
    <p class="text-s">For this plan, we have Consulted with interested stakeholders. Stand alone apartment residents and waste from snall scale industries are our main stakeholders. we have identified potential waste streams. The possible waste streams that an incident may generate in the community, considering the industrial, agricultural, residential and commercial aspects of the community. Considered waste collection strategies like the waste to be separated into different waste streams before being removed from the site of the incident. We collect the waste from these sites, and then divide them for the products and services that come after.</p>
    
    <p class="text-m">Manure production:</p>
    <p class="text-s">Composting is the natural process of decomposition and recycling of organic material into a humus-rich soil amendment known as compost. Food waste is composed of organic matter which can be used for composting to make fertilizer.</p>
    <p class="text-s">Food waste is a major challenge in the present world, tons of food is thrown away in the garbage. We could use all the food waste and prepare a compost out of them which can be used as organic fertilizer. This way we save the earth from the pollution caused by food waste and also do something productive. Compost has many uses on the farm. It can be used as a soil amendment to improve soil structure, infiltration rate, water holding capacity, and tilth. It will increase soil microorganism populations, soil organic matter and humus. Compost can also be used as a fertilizer supplement for nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and trace elements. Mature compost has no objectionable odor, never "burns" as fertilizers do, can be used to suppress insect pests and soilborne plant pathogens, and act as a fungicide. </p>
    <p class="text-s">We plan on outsourcing the biodegradable waste collected for the production of manure for the farmers through this project.</p>
