    <h2>PLASTIC AND ITS DISPOSAL</h2>
    <div class="blog-topic-grid plastic-grid">
      <img height="120px" src="../images/plastic1.JPG" alt="">
      <p class="text-s">From over 300 million tonnes of plastic produced annually, around 50% of it is single-use plastic. As most plastic is non-degradable, proper management and disposal of plastic is a global problem.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>UPCYCLING</h2>
    <p class="text-s">Upcycling is when used, waste materials are transformed into products that are better in quality or function. The composition of the material is not changed and minimal physical changes are applied which makes it cost-efficient and does not require any technical training either.</p>
    <p class="text-s">Reform Africa is an initiative started in 2018 by three young ladies who upcycle the waste plastic bags into beautiful and sturdy backpacks, shopping bags, and more. This initiative not only focuses on reducing plastic waste pollution in Uganda but also employs single mothers and youth of the community.</p>
  
    <p class="text-s">Reimagined, a startup based in India where multiple waste materials are converted into unique products. They too, like Reform Africa, employ women from a low socio-economic background which helps them become a part of the economy Because of the variety and abundance of plastic, upcycling is a good way of reusing the plastic, often multiple times, before recycling it. </p>
    <p class="text-s">Upcycling is also a preferred alternative to dealing with plastic waste because a lot of energy and resources are saved as no processing of the plastic is required as it is with recycling or downcycling.</p>
    
    <h2>RECYCLING</h2>
    <p class="text-s">When we think about a solution to plastic pollution, the first thing we think about is recycling. Recycling is processing the plastic wastes to produce plastic of the same value and quality as the original plastic. </p>
  
    <p class="text-s">In a true recycling process, recycled plastic could be used for producing the same product.</p>

    <h2>Why recycle?</h2>

    <p class="text-m">Helps reduce waste:</p>
    <p class="text-s">Recycling helps reduce the number of plastic wastes which are put in the dumps, landfills, and oceans. Around 22.9 cubic meters of landfill area could be cleared for every ton of plastic recycled. </p>

    <p class="text-m">Conserves resources:</p>
    <p class="text-s">Producing new plastic is an energy and resources consuming process. Recycling saves two-thirds of the energy and 16.3 barrels (approx. 2,591 liters) of petroleum oil per ton of plastic. The lesser consumption of fuels also lessens the alternate pollution, like the production of greenhouse gases, during the processing.</p>

    <p class="text-m">Keeps material in circulation:</p>
    <p class="text-s">Not only does recycling reduce the strain on the environment, but it has been a major contributor to developing a circular economy. </p>


    <p class="text-s">Now,
      Over 8.3 billion tonnes of plastics have been produced since the early 1950s. Out of this only 9% has been recycled and a staggering 79% ended up in landfills and dumps or our environment.</p>

    <p class="text-s">This is not only because of the irresponsible use and dumping but also because the consumer often fails to realize that many plastics could not be recycled.</p>


    <h2>*Plastic products recycling criteria</h2>
    <p class="text-s">A ) Thermoplastic (i.e it could be melted and hence recyclable) and in good enough condition to be recycled.</p>
    <p class="text-s">B ) Should not be a 'mixed plastic', like disposable cups and dishes, take-away packaging, etc. This is because separating the paper and plastic components might not be possible or would require special machines and labor, which does not make recycling economical.</p>
    <p class="text-s">C ) The plastic must be relatively 'clean' for it to be recycled. Dirty plastics with food or other waste remnants first need to be cleaned which requires labor and hence is not economical.</p>

    <p class="text-s">On average, it costs $4,000 to recycle one ton of plastic. A large portion of the plastic that is being good-naturedly thrown in the recycling bin might still end up in a landfill because processing certain types and a certain quality of plastics is more expensive than throwing it in the landfill or by incineration.</p>
    <p class="text-s">The process of converting waste materials into something useful or valuable is known as upcycling.</p>
    <p class="text-s">Converting garbage into usable material is an action or process.</p>
    <p class="text-s">There is a distinction between recycling and upcycling.</p>
    <p class="text-s">Recycling is the process of breaking down consumer goods such as plastic, paper, metal, and glass so that they can be reused.</p>
    <p class="text-s">Base materials can be used to create a new consumer product, usually of lower quality.</p>
    <p class="text-s">When you upcycle something, you aren't destroying the materials. You may be refashioning it, like cutting a T-shirt.</p>
    <p class="text-s">You've cut your garment into yarn strips, but it's still constructed of the same materials as before. Furthermore, the upcycled object is</p>
    <p class="text-s">Usually of higher or equal quality than the original.</p>
    

    <h2>Upcycling of plastic</h2>
    <p class="text-s">It is the innovative repurposing of plastic waste materials to create new materials of a higher level of quality and environmental value. </p>
    
    <h2>Upcycling plastic is required because:</h2>

    <p class="text-s">• Plastics, in various forms, are non-biodegradable and last a long period in the environment.</p>
    <p class="text-s">• According to a recent UNEP report, by 2050, the oceans will have a 50/50 ratio of plastic to fish.</p>
    <p class="text-s">• Because of its negative influence on the environment, plastic trash is a major source of concern.</p>
    <p class="text-s">• CO2 levels in the air are higher than they have been in the past 400,000 years, according to NASA. Upcycling</p>
    <p class="text-s">• Plastics can help to minimize CO2 emissions produced by burning plastic waste.</p>
    <p class="text-s">• Upcycling plastics supports local businesses and industries while also assisting waste entrepreneurs.</p>

    <h2>Plastic that has been upcycled into products</h2>

    <p class="text-s">• Bottles for shampoo</p>
    <p class="text-s">• Sheeting and film</p>
    <p class="text-s">• Cones for Traffic</p>
    <p class="text-s">• Materials for Packing</p>
    <p class="text-s">• Garbage bags</p>
    <p class="text-s">• Appliances for the kitchen</p>

    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
    <p class="text-s">
      Waste segregation is the sorting and separation of waste types to facilitate recycling and correct onward disposal. Lack of segregation, collection and transportation of unsegregated mixed waste to the landfills has an impact on the 
      environment. When we segregate waste, it reduces the amount of waste that reaches 
      landfills, thereby taking up less space. Pollution of air and water can be considerably reduced when hazardous waste is separated and treated separately. It is essential that waste is put in separate bins so that it can be appropriately dealt with.Segregated waste is also often cheaper to dispose of because it does not require as much manual or mechanical sorting as mixed waste.
    </p>
    <p class="text-s">When we dispose of mixed waste, not only is each material difficult to separate, it also releases toxins in our air, water and soil.  The breakdown of these materials in landfills in the absence of air produces methane - a deadly greenhouse gas that is nearly 25-30 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Toxic leachates from this stinking mess poison ground water.</p>
    <p class="text-s">It is also important to segregate for public health. In particular, hazardous wastes can cause long term health problems, so it is very important that they are disposed of correctly and safely.</p>
