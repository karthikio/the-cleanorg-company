    <h2>Organic Farming Introduction</h2>
    <div class="blog-topic-grid organic-grid">

      <p class="text-s">
        Until the mid-twentieth century, organic farming was the way of life and it was not an alternative farming system. Still, in many third-world countries, where the farmers are not able to afford modern agriculture inputs, it is their way of life. Organic farming is native to this country. Traditional agriculture practices of India dates back more than 4000 years.

    <h2>Importance of organic farming</h2>
    <p class="text-s">
      Organic farming is all about maintaining soil health and it entails producing the highest yields possible, in a sustainable, eco-friendly manner using several techniques. Many studies clearly show that organically grown foods contain fewer pesticide residues than conventional food. Karnataka comes at No 4. Karnataka has the rivers Krishna and Cauvery flowing through the state. A couple of huge irrigation projects on the Cauvery River ensure that Karnataka more than its share of the Cauvery water. This water is useful for the plantation of sugarcane in numbers in the districts of Shimoga, Mysore, Belgaum, and Chitradurga. With a total sugarcane cultivable area of 4 lakh hectares, the output 
      is around 34.6 million tons. Karnataka has their producing high-quality sugarcane with yields touching 84 tons per hectare. The average yield in India is around 75 tons per hectare. Higher temperatures and prolonged dry spells are leading to increased pest attacks, disease outbreaks, and lower yields in sugarcane; organic farming could be the best way to cope.

    <h2>Climate change effects on a farmer (WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?)</h2>
    <div class="blog-topic-grid">
      <img width="200px" src="../images/organic1.JPG" alt="">
      <p style="margin-left: 20px;" class="text-s">Jaikumar Gouda of Khavatakoppa village in Belgaum district of Karnataka is a worried man. Just 10 to 15 years ago, he used to harvest 80 to 90 tonnes of sugarcane per acre, which has now slumped to 40. Variable rainfall, prolonged dry spells and frequent droughts influenced by climate change are affecting the lives of Gouda and other sugarcane farmers in Karnataka and Maharashtra in western India. The erratic monsoon in 2018 characterized by long dry spells, followed by short spells of heavy rainfall, has affected sugarcane cultivation in Belgaum, Bagalkot, Mandya, Bijapur, and Haveri districts of Karnataka and Kolhapur, Ahmednagar, Pune, Sangli, and Satara districts of Maharashtra. “During drought years, sugarcane area and production are going down drastically. Now it has become a routine feature in the tropical climatic zones of coastal Karnataka and Maharashtra,” says Sanjay Patil, Sugarcane Breeder, and Principal Scientist and Head, Agriculture Research Station (ARS), Sankeshwar, Karnataka. “During the drought years, maintaining the sugarcane crop is quite tough in a situation where groundwater is depleting extensively.”</p>

    <p class="text-s">“Scarcity of rainfall lessens the nitrogen, which is an essential nutrient that affects ecosystem productivity. Dry spells had increased the rust disease in sugarcane. If the rainfall is optimum, infestations are less. Pest and fertilization have increased, but sugarcane yield has come down,” said Gouda. Climate change at play Prolonged summer, erratic rainfall, and shortening of the winter season in Belgaum and Kolhapur have drastically reduced sugar production from cane, experts and farmers say. “Incidence of diseases like rust, leaf spots, polka boring, smut, etc. has also increased,” says Ningapappa R. Giddoli, a sugarcane farmer of Yadagud village in Karnataka.</p>
    <p class="text-s">Pests like white grubs and aphids thrive due to dry spells and rising temperatures. The white grub pest attack was widespread in 2018 due to unusual rainfall. Rust disease in sugarcane Climate change has increased the incidence of rust disease in sugarcane, experts say. It causes wilting, some leaf tip death, and has accelerated death of leaves. Jaikumar Durgammavar, a sugarcane farmer, shows his 10-acre field and says, “Fluctuation in temperature has caused rust. Fungicide was sprayed but there is no control over the rust.” </p>
      
    <h2>Need for organic farming</h2>
    <img width="400px" src="../images/organic3.JPG" alt="">
    <p class="text-s">“Sugarcane cultivators need to practice organic farming at a large scale,” says agronomist Maruti N. Malawi. “Sufficient quantities of organic manure and compost need to be applied in the water-scarce land plots. Soil and water conservation measures should be the topmost priority. Drip irrigation during dry spells is important. If there is an excess of water and nitrogenous fertilizers, then sugarcane crops will become susceptible to pests and disease. Proper quantity of water through drip irrigation and recommended dose of nitrogenous fertilizers will give a good yield.” Landfills In Bangalore city, one of the major problems is municipal solid management (MSW) due to ever-increasing waste quantity along with its changing waste characteristics. Municipal solid waste includes non-hazardous waste generated in houses, institutions, commercial and business establishments in an urban area. </p>
  
    <h2>Organic Food Market, India:</h2>
    <p class="text-s">
      The India organic food market reached a value of USD 849.5 million in 2020. 
      The organic food business in India is booming, thanks to increased consumer awareness of the products. Organic food demand is being driven by a rising level of health consciousness in the country. Indian consumers have begun to pay attention to the nutritional content and quality of the food they eat, resulting in an increase in demand for organic food. Furthermore, due to factors such as strong economic growth, urbanisation, and rising income levels, consumer expenditure on health and wellness items has expanded considerably.
    </p>

    <p class="text-s">
      The Indian Organic Food Market is expected to increase at a CAGR of 21.00 percent from USD177.14 million in FY2020 to USD553.87 million in FY2026, owing to favourable government policies promoting organic farming and rising land area under organic cultivation.
      Organic farming was certified on 5.21 million hectares in 2012-13, up from 1.08 million hectares in 2009-10, indicating a rise in overall organic food output in the country.
    </p>

    <h2>Global Organic Food Market:</h2>
    <p class="text-s">At a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.7%, the worldwide organic food industry is predicted to expand from $201.77 billion in 2020 to $221.37 billion in 2021. At a CAGR of 14.5 percent, the organic food industry is estimated to reach $380.84 billion in 2025. From 2022 to 2031, the global organic food and beverage market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.9 percent, from $187,485.6 million in 2020 to $860,625.7 million in 2031. The global organic food and beverage market has grown as people have become more aware of their health and the various health benefits of consuming organic foods and beverages.</p>
